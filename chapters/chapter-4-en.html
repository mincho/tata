                <p>I left school without much drama, but not without conflict. I had been at Externado de San José since I was little, and in third year of high school I had a clash with one of the priests. An issue of unpaid bills, an attitude I didn't like... and I ended up leaving. For my father and for me, it was more a decision of dignity than a punishment.</p>

                <p>I finished high school at Liceo Centroamericano. I obtained my bachelor's degree with a note from the rector, Don Santiago Echegogen, to pursue university studies to become a Civil Engineer.</p>

                <p>I went through the classic dilemma: medicine, law, engineering? All the vocational tests said the same thing: "You could be good at any of them." Useful, but useless at the same time.</p>

                <p>I decided on civil engineering at the University of El Salvador. I did a year and a half, almost two. But then an unexpected opportunity appeared: the construction of the Coastal Highway. A megaproject that would cross the country from end to end, and that needed technical personnel—surveyors, inspectors, engineers in training. Without a degree yet, but with a lot of desire, I got a position as supervisor.</p>

                <p>I was hired by an American supervisory company: KTAM—Knappen-Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy. The builder was a Mexican company called El Águila. I was assigned to the section between La Libertad and Acajutla, and it was there that my adult life really began.</p>

                <p>We lived in motel-type camps, designed for engineers and supervisors. They gave us food, a vehicle, a driver... the basics to be able to work without distractions. My job was to supervise especially the construction of five tunnels, including one over 500 meters long. We had to measure every cubic meter of rock that came out, make sure the contractor didn't overcharge, and keep the work within standards. Nothing glamorous. Lots of dust, lots of early mornings, and lots of responsibility.</p>

                <p>But there, among tunnels and hills, I began to save. Since I had no expenses, I could save a good part of my salary. In two years, I gathered enough to buy my ticket to the United States and have something to start a new life.</p>

                <p>I did all this while still helping my parents. Part of my salary went to pay the rent for the family home. There were many of us, and every contribution counted. But the idea of the trip was already running through my head like a song that won't go away. In those days, a good friend of mine, José Roberto Aguilar—we called him "el Chele"—lived in Philadelphia. He helped me plan the leap. He had contacts, a place where I could stay the first few days, and most importantly: he gave me confidence.</p>

                <p>One day I simply said: "It's now or never."</p>

                <p>I bought the ticket. I left the job. I told my family. And I got on a plane.</p>

                <p>My life in El Salvador had been intense, full of learning. But something inside me knew that what was coming would be even more transformative.</p>
