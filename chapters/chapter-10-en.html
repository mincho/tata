            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>After many years in Washington, life gradually led me back to El Salvador. It wasn't a dramatic or impulsive return. It was rather a natural process. My children were already adults, work at the IDB and IIC had ended, and the country—although different—remained the place where everything began.</p>

                <p>However, my return did not only mean contemplation. At 59 years old I embarked, almost without intending to, on a new professional stage. I assumed the presidency of Banco Hipotecario between 1995 and 2000, one of the oldest and most respected banks in the country. It was a symbolic and emotional turn: sixty years earlier, my father had worked at that same institution, and somehow his mark was still there.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Afterward, my path led me to collaborate with various microfinance institutions—Fundasalva, Financiera Calpia and others—where I found satisfaction in supporting projects that brought credit and opportunity to broader sectors of society. I also assumed a leadership role at Findesa, in Nicaragua, accompanying the institution in an expansion process that consolidated its presence in the region. And, at a moment of closure and fulfillment, in 2012 I was appointed to the Board of Directors of Citibank. I remained in that position even when Citi sold its consumer banking and the entity recovered its historic name: Banco Cuscatlán. It was a circular return, almost poetic, to the same bank where I had started my career decades earlier.</p>

                <p>That professional return was accompanied by another, perhaps more valuable: that of social and personal life. With Aída we reconnected with so many friends from our youth, and we also made new friendships that filled those years with company and joy. Social life in San Salvador allowed us to feel part of a community again, to share celebrations, gatherings and trips. And, in my case, I rediscovered my love for golf at the Club Campestre Cuscatlán, where I had already become a member in the sixties, during my time at Citi. There I spent countless mornings and afternoons, enjoying the sport, the friendship and the calm that only a golf course can offer.</p>

                <p>I have lived between two worlds, worked in several countries, and seen much change—in El Salvador and in myself. Along the way, I have been fortunate to have true friendships, some from childhood, others forged at work or during the years in Washington, which have enriched my life in ways no professional achievement could match. I am grateful for my family, for the opportunities I had, and for the people who helped me at each stage. I don't write this to highlight accomplishments, but to leave a simple record of how it was. For my children, my grandchildren, and for anyone who wants to know a bit more about where we come from.</p>
