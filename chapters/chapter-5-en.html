                <p>I arrived in Philadelphia in 1957. I was 22 years old, with a suitcase, some saved money, and a rather vague idea of what was to come. But I had hunger. Hunger to learn, to advance, to do something different with my life.</p>

                <p>My friend "el Chele" Aguilar received me and already had two interviews prepared for me. One as a messenger at Western Union. The other, as a draftsman at a structural engineering firm. I went to the second interview and, thanks to what I had learned at the university in San Salvador, I got the job. I didn't speak much English, but I did know how to draw.</p>

                <p>The company was called AW Lookup Company, after the owner's last name, Arthur Lookup. I started earning 60 cents an hour. It was little, but for me it was an open door. I lived in a small apartment in the north of the city, in the Frankford area, along with other Salvadorans. It was cramped, yes, but full of solidarity. We shared rice, stories, advice and, sometimes, the frustrations of exile.</p>

                <p>I worked all day, from 8:30 to 5:00. In the evenings, I studied English at Temple University. When I felt I had mastered it enough, I enrolled at Drexel Institute of Technology to continue with engineering. But the load was brutal: working all day, studying at night. After several semesters, I decided to change course.</p>

                <p>I transferred to Wharton Evening School of Economics and Finance located in Philadelphia, a program for people who worked full time. I knew it was going to take me twice as long... and it did: eight years to finish what normally takes four. But I obtained the degree and a letter from the Director.</p>

                <p>During all that time I continued working at Lookup. They offered me raises, trust, and responsibilities. But every time I tried to look for a job more aligned with my studies—in banking or finance—they told me the same thing: "You haven't graduated yet" or "your current salary is higher than what we can offer you." So I stayed.</p>

                <p>Life in Philadelphia wasn't easy, but it wasn't lonely either. I met many Salvadorans, Argentinians, Peruvians, and Americans who became part of my world. One of them was Blair Birdsall, an American engineer married to a Salvadoran. He had worked on the famous Golden Bridge in El Salvador. He was an expert in suspension bridges, a quiet genius. He became almost a mentor to me—a father figure in a foreign land. He helped me make key decisions and gave me a broader vision of life.</p>

                <p>I lived in several apartments—at first always shared—and then alone. I managed. Sometimes I was invited to dinner at friends' houses, other times I ate rice and eggs for a whole week. Calling El Salvador was expensive, so we wrote letters. My mother came to visit me once, also some of my sisters. But in general, it was 10 years without returning more than two or three times.</p>

                <p>Little by little, I adapted. I socialized with other Latino students. I joined international groups. And, of course, I also dated some girlfriends. I particularly remember two Argentinian women, one of them a doctor in biology. Very intelligent, very serious. We were about to get engaged, but I had a big doubt: What if I got married... where would we live? I didn't feel ready.</p>

                <p>I always knew that Philadelphia was not my final destination. I had come to train, to work, to save. But my heart—and my future—still pointed toward El Salvador.</p>

                <p>Ten years after arriving in Philadelphia, I felt it was time to return to my country. I spoke with my boss and asked for long vacation. I traveled to San Salvador and took advantage of the opportunity to do interviews. Among them, one with Citibank, which was looking for young talent with international training. I was lucky. They offered me the position of Junior Executive Trainee—a program to train me as a credit officer.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>I returned to Philadelphia with the decision made. I packed my bags. Lookup bid me farewell with several parties and many kind words. It was a decade of sacrifice, but also of growth, of discovery, of building myself from scratch.</p>
