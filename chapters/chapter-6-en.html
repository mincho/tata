                <p>Before returning to El Salvador for good, I wanted to take a trip I had been dreaming of for years: Europe. It was 1965. I still lived in Philadelphia, worked at Lookup, studied at Wharton at night, and had been saving with discipline for years. Finally, the moment arrived.</p>

                <p>Thanks to my uncle Heinz Deneke, who lived in Hamburg and was in the export business, I managed to buy a completely new Volkswagen Beetle—one of those classic bugs that are now seen in museums—for $1,100. I picked it up in Hamburg, Germany directly. It was also the year I got my first American Express card.</p>

                <p>I flew from Philadelphia to Frankfurt, and from there took a train to Hamburg, where I was received by Bettina, a distant cousin. I stayed at my uncle Heinz's house one night. The next day, I picked up the car and started out without a very precise itinerary, just an emotional compass: Salzburg, Vienna, Rome... I wanted to see culture, history, music—everything I had read and heard about for years.</p>

                <p>In Salzburg, I breathed Mozart's air. In Vienna, I walked through elegant streets and museums that seemed infinite. Later I crossed into Italy and arrived in Rome, where I slept in a hostel full of students from all over the world. People spoke in English, sometimes in French, rarely in Spanish. The food was cheap, the wine even more so, and the nights were filled with stories shared with strangers who felt close.</p>

                <p>I stayed in youth hostels, those mythical places where you slept for two or three dollars, and where one could meet a Japanese student one night and an Argentinian the next. Sometimes I picked up hitchhiking travelers, like a young man from India with whom I traveled through part of France.</p>

                <p>Driving on the German highways. The Beetle performed like a champion. In Rome I visited the Vatican, in Florence I saw works that to this day seem unreal to me, and in Pisa I climbed the famous tower. Then I passed through the French Riviera, with a stop at the famous Monte Carlo casino, and continued toward Normandy.</p>

                <p>I wanted to know the place where the Allies landed in World War II, which at that time had ended just twenty years earlier. I stopped at Omaha Beach, saw the German bunkers, and remains of sunken ships that still protruded from the water. There I slept one night in the car, looking at the sea.</p>

                <p>Finally, I arrived in Paris, where I spent several days walking nonstop. Museums, bookstores, cafes, freshly baked bread. Paris made me think that perhaps in another life I was European. Or maybe just a young Salvadoran absorbing everything with wide-open eyes.</p>

                <p>Before returning, I drove to Le Havre, the French port from where I shipped the Beetle by boat to Philadelphia. My trip had ended, but I felt that something in me had awakened: a mix of freedom, humility, and a certainty that the world was much bigger—and more interesting—than one could imagine.</p>

                <p>A few months later, I was packing my things in Philadelphia to return to El Salvador, now with a degree, experience, a new car... and a heart full of stories.</p>

                <p>Instead of leaving the car in the United States, I decided to embark on one last great adventure: driving the Beetle from Philadelphia to San Salvador. It was thousands of kilometers of highway, crossing states, borders and landscapes that seemed to never end. The car, small but tireless, became my travel companion. Sometimes I picked up hitchhikers who kept me company for some stretches; we shared stories, songs, and the silence of the open road. In the end, after days of driving, I crossed the Salvadoran border with a mix of exhaustion and triumph. The Beetle that I had bought in Germany, that had crossed the Atlantic, now rested on the streets of my homeland.</p>
