            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>I returned to El Salvador in 1967. After ten years away, the country felt the same... but I wasn't. I had changed. I had lived alone, worked, studied, traveled half the world. I was returning with another way of seeing things and with the desire to start a new stage.</p>

                <p>Upon arrival, I found a difficult family situation: my parents, Mincho and Hilda, had separated and lived in different houses. As an attempt at symbolic reconstruction, I rented an apartment where both could live together again. Although the relationship between them was no longer the same, we achieved a certain balance. For a time, Sundays became family reunion days again, with shared dinners and the bustle in the kitchen.</p>

                <p>At the same time, a new professional stage began at Citibank. It was there that I met Aída Márquez, who shortly after my arrival also began working at the bank. We met in that professional environment, sharing ideas, responsibilities and challenges.</p>

                <p>But very soon, the professional gave way to the personal. Meeting Aída was one of the great fortunes of my life. Intelligent, clear, direct and deeply ethical, she was—and is—a woman with a firm vision and admirable will. She was never a secondary figure; she was a companion, advisor, and accomplice in the best and worst moments.</p>

                <p>We got married in 1969 at the San José de la Montaña Church. The priest was a young, kind and practical Spaniard, who prepared us with conversations that were more real than theoretical. He didn't speak in the abstract about marriage; he talked about coexistence, about differences, about the daily decisions that make or break a relationship.</p>

                <p>That day marked the beginning of a life together that has not been easy, but has been deeply meaningful. Aída has been by my side in every move, in every new job, in every loss and every achievement. She has helped me see what I didn't see, to stay calm when everything seemed to fall apart, and to celebrate the good moments with humility.</p>

                <p>Soon our two children were born. First María Raquel, and then Benjamín a couple of years later, whom everyone would end up calling Mincho, like me and my father. With them, the family felt complete.</p>

                <p>The arrival of our children transformed everything. Suddenly, priorities changed. The professional continued to be important, but there was something bigger that drove me: the responsibility to raise my children with love, with stability, with a clear example of what it means to be a person of integrity. Seeing my children grow up in our own home gave me a satisfaction that no degree or promotion could equal.</p>

                <p>Being a father forced me to think more long-term. It was no longer just a matter of advancing at work or building assets, but of forming character, leaving a legacy. I worried about the kind of country they would grow up in, about the opportunities they would have, about the values they would learn not from what I said, but from what they saw in me.</p>

                <p>At first we lived in a rented house in Colonia Harrison, a quiet place surrounded by trees. Then we moved to Colonia Escalón, where we began to establish roots. In an unexpected stroke of luck, I won a lottery prize that allowed me to buy land.</p>

                <p>I designed the house with an architect friend, Chava Choussy, partner of my friend Remo Bardi, and we built it with effort. It was modern, with a pool, and became not only our home, but also a space where we organized bank cocktail parties and meetings with clients. It was also the house where the rest of our family was born and grew up. It was, without a doubt, a dream house, built in a moment of hope and projection.</p>

                <p>At Citibank, my career grew rapidly. Citi brought new concepts: structured financing, more rigorous credit analysis, products that didn't yet exist in local banking. But not everyone understood it. When I joined, there were eight Americans working in the office; six years later, I occupied the number one position and only one American remained. It was something very unique at that time for a non-American to come to head a country office.</p>
