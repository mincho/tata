                <p>I was born on December 7, 1935 in Santa Ana, El Salvador, the second largest city in the country. I remember those early years with a mix of nostalgia and wonder, as if they were scenes recorded in sepia: sunny patios, fig trees, thick walls and long days that seemed eternal.</p>

                <p>My first clear memory is from when I was five years old. I would escape from the house in Santa Ana and go to the nearby park. It wasn't a mischievous act with bad intentions, I simply enjoyed talking with the children who shined shoes. They were older than me, perhaps eight or nine years old, and came from very different realities. They didn't wear shoes themselves, but they knew how to shine others' like experts. I was fascinated listening to them.</p>

                <p>For my mother, those escapades were a serious concern. She would search for me everywhere, but almost always found me in the park, sitting among my new friends. Back then, the city was calm; there wasn't that paranoia of danger that exists today. But not everyone looked favorably upon me, a middle-class child, hanging out with the shoe shiners. I received more than one reprimand for it. I remember someone saying: "How is it possible that Mincho Vides's son hangs out with those people?" But I didn't understand it as something bad. I only saw interesting people.</p>

                <p>The house where we lived was typical of that era: a central patio with an enormous fig tree, around which the bedrooms, living room, and a modest kitchen at the back were distributed. At that time we were already seven children—four older sisters, two younger sisters and me—plus my parents. Later, three more siblings would arrive. We slept two or three per room, but we didn't feel it as a burden. That was simply how life was.</p>

                <p>I don't remember going to school in Santa Ana. At that stage, formal education was not yet a priority for such young children. Most learning came from home, the street, or adults' stories.</p>

                <p>My father, Mincho, was a serious and hardworking man. In the mornings, he would play classical music on an old gramophone. I liked listening to those large, heavy records spinning slowly while melodies that seemed to come from another world played. Over time, that custom became part of family life: all of us children in the house woke up most days with classical music in the background. Composers like Mozart, Verdi and especially Beethoven would play, whose Fifth Symphony I still remember vividly—that unmistakable rhythm marked the beginning of many mornings in our home.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Food, like everything at home, followed its traditional rhythm. Cooking was done at home, always. Eating out was unthinkable. My mother, Hilda, didn't cook every day, but we had a maid who took care of the kitchen and another who washed and ironed clothes. That was the typical arrangement for many middle-class families at that time.</p>

                <p>Santa Ana was the setting of my earliest childhood, an era of simple games, large families, radios on and an innocence that today seems from another century. It didn't last long: at six years of age, we moved to San Salvador in search of new opportunities. But the roots, those first memories of freedom, discovery and curiosity, remained forever.</p>
