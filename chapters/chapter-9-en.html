                <p>My departure from Citi, with a "leave of absence," not only meant leaving behind an intense professional stage, but also opening the door to a completely different life in Washington, D.C. For my family, the change was unexpected but welcome: we went from life in San Salvador to Bethesda, Maryland, a beautiful suburb of Washington. The adaptation was quick and turned out to be a very positive experience, with new friends, new schools, a new neighborhood, a new language and, in many ways, a new life.</p>

                <p>I began at the IDB as Alternate Director, in a position initially planned for three years. However, at the end of that period, I was retained and promoted to Executive Director, a position of greater responsibility that I held for another three years on the Bank's Board of Directors.</p>

                <p>It wasn't just any position. I represented Central America and Haiti, participating in key decisions about development policies, project financing, and relations with donor countries. It was a world of diplomacy, strategy, and a lot of technical work.</p>

                <p>In those early years on the IDB Board of Directors I forged deep friendships with notable colleagues from the bank, many of them with impressive careers before arriving at the institution. Ray Sternfeld, Executive Vice President, was a man of great intelligence and humanity with whom I cultivated a relationship that lasted far beyond our formal functions. I also developed a close friendship with Rodolfo Silva, former ambassador of Costa Rica to Washington, and with Aníbal Fernández de Soto, who had been mayor of Bogotá.</p>

                <p>As part of the work, travel to member countries was necessary. I toured projects throughout Central America and the Caribbean, but I also represented the bank at international meetings with donor countries traveling to cities all over the world, including Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Paris, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Beijing, Tokyo and many more. They were not only opportunities to dialogue about cooperation and development, but also memorable experiences: formal meetings followed by sumptuous receptions, elegant dinners, illuminated embassies, and conversations that mixed politics, economics and culture until the early hours of the morning. There was a human and diplomatic dimension that made this world as demanding as it was fascinating.</p>

                <p>After more than six years on the IDB Board of Directors, a new opportunity arose. The bank was in the process of creating a parallel institution focused on the private sector: the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC), a new entity focused on granting loans to private companies in Latin America with the aim of fostering economic growth from the business fabric.</p>

                <p>I was hired as a consultant to lead the design of the new institution and coordinate the search for its first president. That's how my relationship with the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC) began, conceived as a parallel to the World Bank's successful private arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The difference was that the IIC's mandate sought to go beyond traditional credit: to grant long-term loans and, in addition, to make capital investments. In a sense we took on the role of a venture capital fund, but with a development vision and a long-term horizon.</p>

                <p>Once the institution was approved and financed—today known as IDB Invest—I joined as regional manager with responsibility for Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Central America and the Caribbean. My previous experience in both the IDB and Citi proved fundamental, as it allowed me to build bridges between the private sector and the demands of development financing. Some of the projects I remember most were [to be defined].</p>

                <p>Throughout my 16 years at both the IDB and IIC, I continued to expand my circle of friendships. Among them, Larry Mellinger, Executive Director for the United States; Carlo Binnetti, director representing Europe; Alex de Sinegeub, director for Central America from Guatemala; as well as Philippe Prosper, Carlos Roa, Jorge Roldan and many others with whom I maintained ties that lasted far beyond my time at the institutions. In the end, those friendships were one of the greatest gifts of my time at the bank.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, our family life in the Washington area was consolidating. The children prospered at school and later attended excellent colleges: my son at Gonzaga and my daughter at Georgetown Visitation, where she became an outstanding basketball player. Both developed great friendships that marked that stage of their lives. Aida, who had always been by my side in the early years of my career supporting me and the family, also began her own professional path: first in banking and later as a real estate agent. We all fondly remember those years in Washington, a time of growth, opportunities and bonds that accompanied us far beyond our stay there.</p>

                <p>Over time, I began to plan my return to El Salvador. No longer as a young professional looking to build his career, but as someone with decades of experience, multiple perspectives and the desire to reconnect with his country from a more mature and contemplative place. My father, Benjamin, had passed away in 1978 and my mother, Hilda, in 1983, so returning was also different: it was no longer returning to the parental home, but finding myself with a country and an extended family that had changed in my absence.</p>
