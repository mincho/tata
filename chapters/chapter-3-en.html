                    Adolescence arrived as everything in life arrives: without
                    clear warning, but with signs one doesn't forget. It was a
                    stage of change, of music, of new friendships and of
                    beginning to look at the world with a certain ambition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My older sisters—Eugenia, Hilda, Greta and Violeta—were
                    quite a bit older than me, so we didn't share many things,
                    but I do remember a curious detail: when suitors came to
                    visit them, my father would ask me to sit with them in the
                    living room. It was supposedly to "watch over." Of course,
                    over time, the boyfriends learned to bribe me with five
                    cents to leave. At that age, five cents was a fortune. Over
                    the years, each of my older sisters got married and left
                    home, marking the end of an era and leaving the house a
                    little emptier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With my younger sisters, Elsa and Chon, it was different. I
                    was the oldest, so I had to accompany them to parties or
                    take care of them when we went out. At that time, around 15
                    or 16 years old, neighborhood gatherings where we danced at
                    friends' houses began. One of the most memorable places was
                    the home of Don Chicho Avilés and his children Neto and Ana
                    Maria. They had a good record player, good music, and above
                    all, tolerant parents who understood the importance of
                    letting young people gather.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We loved to dance. It was the hobby of the era. The mambo
                    was in fashion, followed by the music of Glenn Miller, Pedro
                    Infante, Jorge Negrete, and other icons. Those nights were
                    magical. We danced until late, and although there wasn't
                    much money, we always found a way to have fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was in that environment that we founded a small social
                    club: The Penguin Club. The name was born without much
                    logic, but with a lot of personality. The purpose was clear:
                    to get together to dance, organize parties and socialize.
                    The thing grew faster than expected. Soon, young people from
                    other schools wanted to be members. We organized big
                    parties, some with up to 150 people. We charged admission,
                    hired music, sold drinks... and for a time, we were a
                    success.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But it wasn't all partying. We also started making hiking
                    trips to the San Salvador volcano. We would climb up and
                    down to the crater. On another occasion, we took a bicycle
                    ride from Comasagua to Puerto de La Libertad. The road to
                    the beach was easy and fun, all downhill; we flew through
                    curves and slopes, feeling the wind on our faces. But the
                    return was another story. Going back up was almost
                    impossible, so we would look for trucks that went slowly up
                    the road and we would grab onto the back for them to pull us
                    uphill. For us, those were great feats—sweaty, improvised,
                    but memorable.

                    As for money, it wasn't easy to come by. In my house there
                    were many siblings and resources were limited. But one
                    managed. Going to the movies was the most accessible
                    entertainment. The shows after 9 at night were cheaper, and
                    if we didn't have money for the bus, we walked back.
                    Sometimes four kilometers, without thinking twice.
