                <p>During the seventies, my work at Citibank placed me right in the center of a country that was beginning to fracture. At first, the signs were subtle: rumors of kidnappings, small attacks, a tension that was felt in the air but that had not yet become everyday. But over time, the situation became increasingly serious. And being at the head of Citi in El Salvador meant being exposed—personally and professionally.</p>

                <p>I had the vision to transform Citi in El Salvador, to take it out of the past and project it toward a more modern, secure and professional future. The bank's operation was already respected and innovative, different from local banking, but it was necessary to take another step. It was my responsibility to lead the office move: we left behind an old and deteriorated building in the historic center of San Salvador, whose basement housed the accounting machines and the enormous safe. We moved the entire operation to a modern building in front of the Camino Real Hotel, a symbol of modernization and security.</p>

                <p>But the political context was worsening. The United States closely followed what was happening in Central America. The Cold War seeped into all levels, and El Salvador became a strategic point. American military and financial aid began to flow, and the conflict intensified.</p>

                <p>I wasn't a political analyst at that time, but I understood that the country was approaching a critical point. I knew it for certain the day that a client—one of our best business clients—came looking for me at my house, early in the morning.</p>

                <p>His brother had been kidnapped. The captors were asking for a considerable sum, and they needed the money in cash, in specific bills, immediately. They asked me for help. Of course, as a bank, we couldn't operate outside the legal framework, but we knew the client's solvency. We authorized an emergency transfer. I called the Citi office in Miami directly.</p>

                <p>They told me the money would be available, but I had to go personally to pick it up. They couldn't simply send it with the pilots.</p>

                <p>That same night, I boarded a twin-engine plane along with a pilot and co-pilot. We made a stop in Cozumel to refuel and landed in Miami at three in the morning. Alicia Lara, a Citi executive in the region, was waiting for me. She had prepared half a million dollars, in small bills. Everything was ready.</p>

                <p>But that's when the problems started.</p>

                <p>From Panama, my boss—the person responsible for Citi for Central America—ordered me not to return on that same plane with the money. He wanted to avoid the bank becoming an informal response mechanism to future kidnappings. I understood, but the decision complicated everything. The pilot and co-pilot didn't want to carry the money without me. I, for my part, was trapped in the middle of an extremely delicate operation, feeling that any decision could have serious consequences.</p>

                <p>Finally, the money returned to El Salvador. But it was in vain. The kidnapped person appeared dead days later. The guerrillas had broken any tacit code. From then on, I understood with complete clarity what we were facing.</p>

                <p>Citi was the target of constant threats. They placed bombs, there were threats to kidnap employees, attacks on companies with American ties. Other ambassadors were kidnapped or assassinated. The tension became part of everyday life.</p>

                <p>In the midst of that uncertainty, a notable coincidence occurred: at that time the representation of Central America on the board of directors of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) corresponded to El Salvador. The Salvadoran government asked me to assume that prestigious position in Washington, DC, and Citi gave me permission to accept the position. The opportunity couldn't have come at a better time, considering the growing difficulties at the bank. I decided to accept it.</p>

                <p>I left Citi with mixed feelings: pride for what was built, frustration for what couldn't be avoided. But also with the feeling that I had done the right thing in the most difficult moments. And that now, another stage was beginning.</p>
