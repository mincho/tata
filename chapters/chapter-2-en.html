                <p>I was six years old when we moved to San Salvador. My father was looking for new opportunities: Santa Ana had offered him what it could, but his banking career needed to grow. He transferred to work at Banco Salvadoreño, in the main office of the capital, and the entire family—already numerous—moved to a neighborhood called Mejicanos.</p>

                <p>There, in that new city, a different stage of my childhood began. It was also where I began to become aware of what was happening around me. I entered first grade at Colegio Externado de San José, run by the Jesuits. It was a demanding school, with very good education, although at that time the facilities were quite rudimentary. I remember we played soccer in a long brick corridor, and the basketball courts were rather improvised.</p>

                <p>We arrived at school by bus. At first, I went accompanied by my older sisters or my father. Later, around eleven or twelve years old, I started getting around by bicycle. The distance was about two kilometers, but in those times traveling it was part of the adventure.</p>

                <p>Some of the friends I made at Externado are still present in my life today. Names like Mauricio Arrieta (the "seco"), Marcelo Suarez, and Roberto Tabanino... with several of them we still get together, as a kind of unspoken pact that comes from those first days of childhood.</p>

                <p>Weekends were simple. On Saturdays, my dad often worked half a day, and on Sundays he would take us for walks around the city. The school routine included mass every day at 8 in the morning, dressed completely in white. It was a Catholic school and that was respected. For us children, it was hard to understand the discipline of that routine, but we accepted it. Additionally, for a time I was an altar boy. I accompanied Father López to give mass on some weekends in small nearby towns.</p>

                <p>When we moved to Colonia América, everything changed. It was there that I began to form a group of inseparable friends, including the Apóstolo brothers, Pedro and Mauricio, who had just returned from living in Italy. At that time nobody had a car, so on Sundays we would take a bus together to Santo Tomás, and from there we would walk more than an hour and a half until we reached Lake Ilopango. We swam, rented cayucos for 25 cents a day, and spent hours rowing, swimming and exploring. It was an adventure every time. We returned home exhausted but happy. Sometimes, if we were lucky, a friend's father who did have a car, Dr. Garcia Prieto, would pick us up at the end of the day. It was an almost sacred Sunday routine, and one of the freest and happiest times of my youth.</p>

                <p>It was also at that time that I really discovered swimming. We lived near the National Stadium, which had an Olympic pool. The coach of the national team, Dr. Rubén Baraza, was married to a cousin with the surname Sigui, so there was a family connection that opened doors for me. Thanks to that, they let me in as a kind of team mascot. It was an incredible experience to be able to learn to swim surrounded by the best swimmers in El Salvador. I watched their training, the seriousness with which they prepared, and little by little I began to swim too, trying to imitate them.</p>

                <p>But if there's one memory that defines that era for me, it's the Atomic Gang.</p>

                <p>We were a group of neighborhood kids who would meet at night, after dinner. The streets were dirt, the light posts hollow metal. The first one who finished eating would go out and throw a stone at the post, and that was the "call." One by one we would come out until there were eight or ten of us, all from the same block. We played, told each other stories, and daydreamed.</p>

                <p>We called it The Atomic Gang in honor of the atomic bomb, which at that time was a symbol of power, of something new and amazing (although we didn't really know what it meant). The name seemed modern, bold, almost futuristic to us.</p>

                <p>Life was simple. The days were long and unhurried. There were few worries. My mother, Hilda, kept having children—we were already ten in total—and at the same time helped maintain the household economy by opening a small store in the garage. She sold fruits, cigarettes, the basics. We didn't have much, but I never felt we lacked what was important.</p>

                <p>My mom was patient, loving, and although she wasn't strict, she always pushed us to fulfill our duties. My dad worked long hours, so supervision of our school lives was rather flexible. That freedom, sometimes, we used to escape to the movies instead of returning to school in the afternoon. And nobody found out.</p>

                <p>They were years of discovery. Of growing up with friends, of swimming in lakes, of forming secret clubs and making sense of the world in our own way.</p>
